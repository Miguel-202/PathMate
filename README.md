## Overview
PathMate is designed to bridge the gap between aspiring professionals—or anyone looking to achieve a specific set of goals—and the realization of those goals.

This app covers everything from legal paperwork to skills enhancement opportunities, making it ideal for students, young professionals, and anyone looking to streamline their career path.

With adjustable time durations and frequency recommendations, PathMate ensures that you stay on track to achieve any type of goal you set.
